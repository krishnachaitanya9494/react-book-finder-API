## 🧠 Development Process

### **Level 1 (50%) — Working with AI**

The development process began by collaborating with **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** to brainstorm, plan, and implement the project.  
This included:
- Understanding the user requirements and persona (Alex)
- Deciding the structure: components for `SearchBar`, `BookList`, and main `App`
- Breaking down each line of code and understanding how React state and props work
- Debugging and optimizing API calls

### **Level 2 (30%) — Working Application**

A fully functional Book Finder application was developed using **React** and **Open Library API**.

#### 🔍 Core Functionalities
- Search for books by title  
- Display matching results with book cover, title, author, and year  
- Handle empty search input and API errors  
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS  
- Loading state indicator while fetching data  

#### 💻 Live Demo

### **Level 3 (20%) — Code Sharing & Documentation**

The code is modular, readable, and well-documented. Each component handles a single responsibility:
- `SearchBar.jsx` — handles user input and triggers the search  
- `BookList.jsx` — displays book results dynamically  
- `App.jsx` — manages global state, API fetching, and layout  

All setup instructions, project overview, and usage details are included in this README for clarity.
